# who-isnt-following-back
A simple program to figure out who isn't following you back on instagram

Look at `instagram.py` and the images to get an idea of how this works.

## Instructions for use

Note: These instructions are designed to help you along, but _they do not to hold your hand through every step_. You will probably need to try multiple times, reread to check your interpretation, and review the visual aids over and over again.

1. Download and unzip the project files. Click on the green "<> Code" button, then choose "Download ZIP." After the download completes, open Finder, find the downloaded .zip file in your downloads, and open it. This should create a folder called `who-isnt-following-back-main`. Open the folder and make sure you can see all the files, most importantly: `follower-html.txt`, following-html.txt`, and `instagram.py`.

2. Now we'll get the list of your instagram following. [Go to instagram.com using google chrome on a computer, sign in, and go to your profile](https://github.com/mrsharp-milken/who-isnt-following-back/blob/main/get-to-following-1.png). Click on the part of your profile that shows how many accounts you are following.

3. Now that you have the window of the accounts you are following open, scroll all the way to the bottom to load the list all of your following. This may take a little while.
